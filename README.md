# signup-form

I’m applying what I’ve learned about form fields and CSS properties by creating a sign-up page for a project.
To push myself further, I’ve decided to design the page in Figma before moving on to coding.
Since I’ll be building my own website eventually, this project feels like a great opportunity to design the sign-up page specifically for my future site.
